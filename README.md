# roadmap-story-feature
You are required to build a “Story” feature similar to those found in popular social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. The goal is to allow a user to post short, ephemeral content that disappears after 24 hours. As this is a Frontend project this is going to be client-side only.
